# DismissedBot
- A multifunctional Discord bot focused on being very user friendly, easy to use but also useful and fun.

It's still under development, as well as private. If you want to come check it out, I suggest you join the only public server the bot is currently on by following [this](https://discord.gg/PvR6UKD) link.

##contributing
I accept any PRs/issues of you guys if you think something could be done better or simply want to help out. If you simply want to leave a feedback, DM the bot with your message and follow its steps. (And yes, for the pirates out there, "aye aye" and "(y)arr" are also valid confirmation messages)
